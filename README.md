one-dimensional motion:

- time - number of seconds that pass during motion

- position - spot on graph from one point in time to another point in time

- velocity - a change in position over time

- acceleration -  a change in velocity over time

acceleration
V = v0 + (a * t)

displacement
(x - x0) = (v0 * t) + (1/2 * a * t^2)
