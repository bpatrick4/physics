one-dimensional motion:

- time - number of seconds that pass during motion

- position - spot on graph from one point in time to another point in time

- velocity - a change in position over time

- acceleration -  a change in velocity over time

displacement:
- x - x0 = v0(t) + 1/2 * a(t)^2

average velocity:
- avg(v) = displacement / timeElapsed

final velocity:
- v = v0 + a(t)

acceleration:
- a = 2 * (s - v0(t)) / t^2
