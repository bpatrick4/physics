## one-dimensional motion:
displacement:
- x - x0 = v0(t) + 1/2 * a(t)^2

average velocity:
- avg(v) = displacement / timeElapsed

final velocity:
- v = v0 + a(t)

acceleration:
- a = 2 * (s - v0(t)) / t^2

terms:
- time - number of seconds that pass during motion

- position - physical spot on timeline/axis

- velocity - a change in position over time

- acceleration - a change in velocity over time

## electricity
charge:
- coulomb = amperes * seconds

current:
- amperes = voltage / resistance

power:
- watts = amperes * voltage

energy: 
- joules = watts * seconds

terms:
- charge - the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electro-magnetic field.

- current - charge per second through a conductor

- power - rate of transfer of energy

- energy - ability to do work
